# sendgmail

sendgmail is a tool that uses Gmail in order to mimic `sendmail` for `git
send-email`.

## Obtaining OAuth2 credentials for sendgmail

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

    *   Create a new project. You probably want to name it something like
        *sendgmail* in **IAM & Admin > Settings** and also in **APIs &
        Services > OAuth consent screen**.

2.  Go to the
    [Go quickstart](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/go) page
    of the Gmail API documentation.

    *   Click the **Enable the API** button. It will open another page in your
        browser. Follow the steps on that page to enable the Gmail API for the
        project that you created.

    *   Follow the steps in the **Authorize credentials for a desktop
        application** section. However, set the application type to *Web
        application* (i.e. instead of *Desktop app*) and then add
        `http://localhost:5000/` as an authorised redirect URI. This is necessary
        for seeing the authorisation code on a page in your browser.

    *   When you download the credentials as JSON, create the
        `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/sendgmail` directory with file mode
        `0700` and then save the file to that directory as `config.json` with
        file mode `0600`.

        For historical reasons, when the file named `config.json` does not exist
        under your config directory, sendgmail will try looking for a file named
        `.sendgmail.json` in your home directory.

3.  Go back to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen** in the Google Cloud
    console.

    *   Add `USERNAME@gmail.com` as a test user. This is necessary for using the
        project that you created.

    *   Add `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope. This is necessary for using
        Gmail via SMTP.
